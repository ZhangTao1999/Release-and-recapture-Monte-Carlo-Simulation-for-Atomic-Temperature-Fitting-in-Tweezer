# Release-and-recapture-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Atomic-Temperature-Fitting-in-Tweezer
This repository contains Matlab (maybe python version will come soon) version code for Monte Carlo simulation of atom release and recapture experiments in optical tweezers to fit the temperature.
## How to use
Simply download the Matlab file and run it directly to see the result just like the example png shows.
## What's going on in this code?
This code is written according to Tuchendler et al., PRA 78, 033425-3 (2008).
In order to determine the temperature of the atoms in the tweezers, we need to implement a procedure called "Release and Recapture", where atoms are firstly loaded into tweezers, and then we turn off the tweezer light for a while (corresponding to the "release_time" variable in the Matlab code). Afterwards, the tweezers are turned on again, and we calculate the recapture probability, i.e. the probability that atoms remain in the trap.
However, only results from the experiment itself cannot determine the temperature of the atom, so we need to simulate this process, and fit the experimental data into the simulation results.
In this code, I perform Monte Carlo simulations of the trajectories of the single atoms, to determine the probability that the atoms are recaptured after release_time. We assume that the atoms are in the harmonic approximation of the trapping potential, and that the distribution of position and velocity of the atoms in the trap follows obeys Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
The standard deviations of the position of the atom in the axial and radial directions of the trapping potential are respectively $\Delta x_{\|}=\sqrt{k_B T / m \omega_{\|}^2}$ and $\Delta x_{\perp}=\sqrt{k_B T / m \omega_{\perp}^2}$. The standard deviation of the velocity is $\Delta v$ $=\sqrt{k_B T / m}$, where $T$ is the temperature of the atoms.
For each simulation trial, I use the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to randomly generate the 3-dimensional position-velocity vector $\left(x_i, y_i, z_i, v_{x, i}, v_{y, i}, v_{z, i}\right)$ of the atom in the potential for a given temperature. Then, the trajectory of the atom is calculated classically during the release_time. The position of the atom after this release time is $\left(x_i+v_{x, i} \times releasetime, y_i+v_{y, i} \times releasetime, z_i+v_{z, i} \times releasetime-g \times releasetime^2 / 2\right)$. The velocity of the atom after this release time is $(v_{x, i}, v_{y, i}, v_{z, i}-g*releasetime)$. Afterwards, we determine the energy of each atom when the trap is turned back on. If the total energy of the atom after the time-of-flight is negative, we consider that the atom is recaptured, otherwise it is considered to have escaped.
